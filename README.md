Protocol
----------

Protocol is a small project I wrote a long time ago. I use it as a reference project when writing Server-Client model processes for games, or anything else that requires that model. It is small, and easily adaptable and expandable to almost any project. 

Feel free to use this for any projects you are working on, but please reference me if you do, with something like "Server-Client model derived from Ashtheking's Protocol project (github.com/Ashtheking/Protocol)."
